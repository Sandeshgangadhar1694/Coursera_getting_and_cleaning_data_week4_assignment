Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data(Week 4 Assignment)

This repository contains R Code ,Documentation files and a datafile(AverageDataset.txt averages of all the variables in the given dataset as grouped by SubjectID and ActivityLabel)

### Input data : 
   Dataset for this project is procured from UCI Archive : 
   [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
   
   Link to Dataset : [Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

### Purpose is to create R script called `run_analysis.R` that does the following:

    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
       variable for each activity and each subject.
